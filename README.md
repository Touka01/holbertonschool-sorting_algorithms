# Sorting Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in the C programming language. These algorithms are commonly used to arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. The code in this repository serves as a resource to learn about different sorting techniques and their implementation in C.

## Introduction

Understanding sorting algorithms is crucial for every programmer, as they provide efficient ways to organize data. This repository aims to present different sorting algorithms and their implementation in C. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate C file and is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the algorithm's logic and steps.

## Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are included in this repository:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

Each algorithm has its own C file within the repository, containing both the algorithm implementation and an example usage. You can explore each algorithm's file to understand its working and analyze its time complexity and space complexity.
